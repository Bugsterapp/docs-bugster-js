></video>

This video shows how to:
- Install the Bugster GitHub App
- Grant repository access
- Choose which repositories to connect
- Set up permissions for PR comments

### 2. Bugster Configuration
After installation, configure when your E2E tests should run:

<video 
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="/media/gh-2v.mp4"
></video>

You'll set up:
- Target repository (e.g., bugster-app-client)
- Target branch (e.g., Developp)
- When to run tests (on pull requests or commits)
- Which test groups to execute

## Configuration Options

### Repository Settings
In Bugster, you'll specify:

1. **Repository**: Pick which repository to run tests on
2. **Branch**: Select the target branch
3. **Actions**: Choose when to run your tests:
   - On pull requests
   - On commits
   - Both
4. **Test Groups**: Pick which [Flow groups](/platform/sections/flow-groups) of tests to run

## Features

- Run your E2E tests automatically on PRs or commits
- Get test results as PR comments
- See test execution status in GitHub checks
- Choose different test groups for different scenarios

## Best Practices

- Set up different test groups for different types of changes
- Configure which branches should trigger test runs
- Use clear test group names
- Monitor test execution times

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Permission Issues**: Check GitHub App installation permissions
- **Missing Test Results**: Verify your action and branch settings
- **Test Group Problems**: Confirm your test group configuration
- **PR Comment Issues**: Check GitHub permissions for comments
