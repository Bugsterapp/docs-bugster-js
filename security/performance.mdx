## Performance Impact

Bugster SDK is designed to have minimal impact on your application:

- Lightweight bundle size (~20KB gzipped)
- Efficient event processing
- Optimized data collection
- Minimal CPU usage

## Benchmarks

Typical performance metrics:

- **Bundle Size**: 20KB gzipped
- **CPU Overhead**: < 1% on average
- **Memory Usage**: 2-5MB
- **Network Impact**: ~50KB per 15 minutes of active use

## Optimization Features

Control Bugster's resource usage:

```javascript
BugsterTracker.init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  performance: {
    maxEventsPerMinute: 100, // Limit event collection rate
    batchSize: 50, // Number of events per batch
    flushInterval: 30000, // Flush interval in milliseconds
    samplingRate: 1.0 // Event sampling rate (0.0 to 1.0)
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Event Throttling**: Configure appropriate event limits
2. **Batch Processing**: Use batch processing for event sending
3. **Sampling**: Implement sampling for high-traffic applications
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Regular performance monitoring

## Advanced Configuration

Fine-tune performance for your specific needs:

- Custom event batching
- Selective event capture
- Network optimization
- Memory management

## Monitoring Tools
