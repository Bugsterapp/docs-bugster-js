## Code Protection

Bugster is designed to protect your source code and intellectual property:

- No source code storage
- Minimal code inspection
- Secure test generation
- Protected intellectual property

## How It Works

1. **Local Processing**: Most code analysis happens locally in the browser
2. **Minimal Data Transfer**: Only necessary interaction data is sent to our servers
3. **No Code Storage**: Your source code never leaves your environment
4. **Secure Test Generation**: Tests are generated without exposing business logic

## Configuration Options

Control how Bugster interacts with your code:

```javascript
BugsterTracker.init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  codePrivacy: {
    excludeScripts: true, // Don't collect script content
    maskSelectors: ['.sensitive-class'], // Mask sensitive elements
    ignoreComments: true, // Don't collect code comments
    maskAttributes: ['data-secret'] // Mask sensitive attributes
  }
});
```

## Security Features

- **Code Obfuscation**: Sensitive code paths are automatically obfuscated
- **Selective Recording**: Control which parts of your application are monitored
- **Data Masking**: Automatically mask sensitive code patterns
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained control over who can access generated tests

## Best Practices

1. Use the configuration options to exclude sensitive code areas
2. Regularly review recorded interactions in your dashboard
3. Implement proper access controls for your team
4. Keep your Bugster SDK up to date for latest security features
