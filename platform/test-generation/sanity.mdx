## AutoTesting Execution

When you onboard your platform into Bugster, the **AutoTesting** feature is automatically triggered. This feature generates **sanity tests** across all the components of your platform, ensuring that key functionalities are tested without any manual effort.

1. After onboarding, Bugster scans your platform and identifies all critical UI components and actions.
2. It automatically generates sanity tests for each component, which cover essential interactions such as:
   - Button clicks
   - Form submissions
   - Navigation flows
   - Page transitions

<Note>
  These sanity tests are designed to ensure that the basic functionality of your
  platform is working correctly, right from the start.
</Note>

## What AutoTesting is Doing?

The **AutoTesting** feature performs the following tasks:

1. **Component Discovery**: It scans your platform to discover all the UI components and their interactions.
2. **Test Creation**: It automatically creates sanity test cases for each component, which test key functionalities such as:
   - User inputs
   - Click events
   - Page loads and transitions
3. **Test Coverage**: It ensures that every critical part of your platform is covered, giving you baseline testing for the entire system.

<Note>
  The sanity tests generated by AutoTesting are designed to detect obvious
  issues and validate that your platformâ€™s core components are functioning
  properly.
</Note>

## Reviewing and Running the AutoGenerated Tests

Once the sanity tests are generated:

1. Go to the **Test Cases** section in Bugster to review the automatically created tests.
2. You can view and edit any test case if necessary.
3. To execute the tests:
   - Navigate to the **Run** section.
   - Select the generated sanity tests.
   - Choose the environment (e.g., development, staging, production) and click **Run Test**.

<Note>
  These sanity tests provide immediate feedback on the health of your platform,
  ensuring that no major functionality is broken after onboarding.
</Note>

## Next Steps

Now that AutoTesting has created and run sanity tests for your platform, you can begin creating more customized tests using Bugster's **Prompt Testing** or **Chrome Extension** features. For advanced configurations or integrating the tests with your CI/CD pipeline, explore our [API Documentation](/api-reference).
