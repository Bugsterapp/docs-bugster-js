This guide will walk you through the process of creating test cases using Bugster's Prompt Testing feature. Follow these steps to translate user stories or requirements into automated tests effortlessly.

## Step 1: Access the Prompt Testing Tool

To begin using the Prompt Testing feature, log in to Bugster and navigate to the **Test Cases** section.

1. Open your browser and go to the Bugster dashboard.
2. On the **Test Cases** page, look for the **Add Test Case** button floating on the right side of the dashboard.
3. Click on **Add Test Case**, then select **Prompt Test** from the dropdown.

<Note>
  Make sure to know the details of the test you are going to prompt. Try to
  include every step.
</Note>

## Step 2: Add Title and Description

Before entering the prompt, you need to provide a title and description for your test case.

1. Enter a **Title** that describes the test case (e.g., _User Registration Test_).
2. Provide a brief **Description** explaining the purpose of the test (e.g., _This test verifies the user registration flow_).

<Note>
  These fields help organize and identify your test cases in the Bugster
  dashboard.
</Note>

## Step 3: Enter Your Prompt

Once the title and description are added, enter a natural language prompt describing the scenario you want to test.

1. In the text field, describe the user action or system behavior (e.g., _As a user, I want to register with my email and password_).
2. You can use detailed prompts for more complex scenarios (e.g., _Verify that a user can log in, update their profile, and save the changes successfully_).

# Step 4: Generate the Test

After entering the prompt:

1. Click **Generate Test**.
2. Bugster’s AI will automatically create a test case based on the actions and scenarios described in your prompt.

<Note>The generated test will include actions and steps of the test.</Note>

## Step 5: Review and Save the Test Case

After generating the test, review the captured actions and assertions:

1. Review the automatically generated test steps. This test case will automatically open on your Bugster Dashboard.

## Next Steps

Now that you've created and saved a test case using Prompt Testing, you can run it, modify it, or add it to a suite for automated testing.
