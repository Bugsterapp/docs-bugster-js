Bugster is an autonomous software testing agent designed for busy developers. Our platform leverages AI to capture user flows, maintain your test suite, and eliminate flaky tests. By automating your testing workflow, Bugster helps development teams deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently.

<Note>
  Get started with a single line of code, let the agent capture user flows, and watch as tests automatically adapt to your UI changes.
