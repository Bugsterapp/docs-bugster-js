## Initial Setup

When you first access the Suggested Flows section without connecting the SDK, you'll see this message:

![No SDK Connected](/media/suggested-flow-no-sdk.png)

To start receiving flow suggestions, you'll need to [complete the SDK configuration](/platform/getting-started/sdk-setup). Once the SDK is properly connected, you'll see this status:

![SDK Connected - Waiting for Data](/media/sdk-waiting-data.jpg)

## Data Collection Period

After connecting the SDK, Bugster needs time to analyze user behavior in your application:

- Initial analysis can take up to 24 hours, depending on your user traffic
- The quality and relevance of suggested flows will improve over time as more data is collected
- More user interactions lead to better and more accurate suggestions

## Managing Suggested Flows

Once Bugster has collected enough data, you'll see a list of suggested flows with:
- Flow descriptions
- Occurrence frequency
- Relevance indicators

For each suggested flow, you can:
1. Review the complete flow details by clicking on it
2. Dismiss irrelevant flows using the thumbs down button
3. Configure flow settings:
   - Select credentials
   - Set the starting path
   - Choose the target environment

Here's how to add a suggested flow to your test suite:
