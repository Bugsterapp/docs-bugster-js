## Existing Flows

In this section, you can view all the test flows that have been created in your application. A flow is a test sequence where the Bugster agent performs specific tasks in your application to verify it's working as intended.

## Flow Details

When you click on a specific flow, you can access:

- Detailed view of all steps performed during the initial flow creation, including screenshots
- Executions tab showing the history of all runs for this flow
- Settings tab where you can configure:
  - Credentials
  - Dependent Flow
  - Environment
  - Starting Point

## Adding New Tests

Currently, the natural language test creation is under development (coming soon). The current way to add new tests is by converting suggested flows from Bugster into actual test flows.

To create a new test, you'll need to navigate to the [Suggested Flows](/platform/sections/suggested-flows) section where you can review and convert Bugster's suggestions into automated test flows.
