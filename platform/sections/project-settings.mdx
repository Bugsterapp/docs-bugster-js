The Project Settings section in Bugster provides a comprehensive suite of configuration options to customize and optimize your testing environment. In this documentation, we'll walk through each tab of the project settings, explaining their functionality and how to make the most of each feature.

Let's explore each tab in detail:

## Project Settings Tabs

### Test Management

### SDK
The SDK section provides everything you need to integrate Bugster into your frontend application. Here you'll find your API key and comprehensive installation guides for the most common frameworks.

Once you've accessed your API key, you'll need to integrate the SDK into your project. Visit our [SDK Integration Guide](/sdk) for detailed instructions on implementing the code snippet for your specific framework. After completing the integration, return here to verify your setup.

After adding the code snippet to your project, you can verify the integration status by clicking the refresh button:

Once properly configured, you'll have full control over your SDK implementation. You can remotely activate or deactivate the SDK at any time, which is useful when you want to temporarily stop event collection:

This remote activation/deactivation feature gives you complete control over when Bugster collects events from your application, allowing you to manage data collection according to your needs.
