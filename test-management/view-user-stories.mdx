## Introduction

Viewing captured user stories is a crucial step in the test management process with Bugster SDK. These stories provide valuable insights into how users interact with your application, forming the basis for your automated tests. This guide will walk you through the process of accessing, analyzing, and interpreting the user stories captured by Bugster SDK.

## Accessing the User Stories Dashboard

1. Log in to your Bugster SDK account at [https://bugster.app/](https://bugster.app/).
2. Navigate to your project by selecting it from the project dropdown menu.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "User Stories" to access the User Stories Dashboard.

## Understanding the User Stories Dashboard

The User Stories Dashboard provides an overview of all captured user interactions. Here's what you'll see:

- **Story List**: A chronological list of captured user stories.
- **Filters**: Options to filter stories based on various criteria.
- **Search Bar**: A tool to search for specific stories or actions.
- **Summary Statistics**: An overview of story count, average story length, and other relevant metrics.

## Anatomy of a User Story

Each user story in the list contains the following information:

- **Story ID**: A unique identifier for the story.
- **Timestamp**: When the story was captured.
- **Duration**: How long the user interaction lasted.
- **Action Count**: The number of user actions in the story.
- **Starting URL**: The page where the story began.
- **Ending URL**: The page where the story ended.
- **User Info**: Anonymous user identifier (e.g., session ID).

## Viewing Story Details

To view the details of a specific user story:

1. Click on a story in the list to expand it.
2. You'll see a detailed timeline of user actions, including:
   - Clicks
   - Form inputs
   - Page navigations
   - API calls
   - UI state changes

Each action is timestamped and includes relevant details such as element selectors, input values, and response data for API calls.

## Analyzing User Flows

Bugster SDK provides tools to help you analyze user flows:

1. **Flow Visualization**: Click the "Visualize" button on a story to see a flowchart representation of the user's journey.
2. **Heatmaps**: Access heatmaps showing where users click most frequently across your application.
3. **Common Paths**: View aggregated data on the most common user paths through your application.

## Filtering and Searching Stories

To find specific stories or types of interactions:

1. Use the filter options to narrow down stories by:
   - Date range
   - Duration
   - Number of actions
   - Starting/ending URL
   - Specific user actions (e.g., form submissions, API calls)

2. Use the search bar to find stories containing specific:
   - URLs
   - Element IDs or classes
   - Input values
   - API endpoints

## Comparing Stories

To compare multiple user stories:

1. Select two or more stories by checking the boxes next to them.
2. Click the "Compare" button that appears.
3. You'll see a side-by-side comparison of the selected stories, highlighting similarities and differences in user flows.

## Exporting Stories

To export user stories for further analysis or sharing:

1. Select the stories you want to export.
2. Click the "Export" button.
3. Choose your preferred format (JSON, CSV, or PDF).
4. The exported file will contain all details of the selected stories.

## Best Practices for Analyzing User Stories

1. **Regular Review**: Set aside time to regularly review new user stories to stay on top of user behavior trends.

2. **Focus on Frequency**: Pay special attention to frequently occurring stories as they represent common user paths.

3. **Investigate Anomalies**: Look for stories that deviate from expected behavior, as they may indicate usability issues or bugs.

4. **Compare Across Versions**: When you release new features, compare user stories before and after to see how user behavior changes.

5. **Collaborate with Team**: Share interesting or problematic user stories with your development and UX teams to drive improvements.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing the user stories you expect:

1. **Check SDK Integration**: Ensure Bugster SDK is correctly integrated into all parts of your application.
2. **Verify Capture Settings**: Review your SDK configuration to make sure you're capturing the desired interactions.
3. **Clear Filters**: Make sure you haven't applied filters that are hiding the stories you're looking for.
4. **Check Time Zone**: Ensure your account's time zone settings match your expectations.

## Privacy and Data Protection

Bugster SDK is designed with privacy in mind:

- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is automatically redacted.
- You can configure additional data scrubbing rules in your SDK settings.
- Comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) when analyzing user stories.

## Next Steps
