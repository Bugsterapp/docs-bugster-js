## Integrate Bugster SDK with React

This guide will help you integrate Bugster SDK into your React project and start using its automated testing capabilities.

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- A React project set up (version 16.8 or later, with hooks support)
- Node.js and npm installed
- A Bugster account with an API key

---

## Step 1: Install Bugster SDK

Install Bugster SDK using your package manager:

```bash
npm i @bugster/bugster-js
```

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables

Add your environment variables to your `.env.local` file and your hosting provider (such as Vercel, Netlify, AWS). You can find your project API key in your project settings.

```bash
REACT_APP_BUGSTER_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Step 3: Initialize

To initialize Bugster SDK, add the following code in your application where it can be initialized globally:

```javascript
import { BugsterTracker } from '@bugster/bugster-js';

let bugster = null;

if (!bugster) {
  bugster = new BugsterTracker({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    endpoint: "https://i.bugster.app",
  });
}

console.log('Bugster initialized:', bugster);
```
