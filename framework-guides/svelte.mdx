## Integrate Bugster SDK with Svelte

This guide will help you integrate Bugster SDK into your Svelte project and start using its automated testing capabilities.

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- A Svelte project set up (version 3.0 or later)
- Node.js and npm installed
- A Bugster account with an API key

---

## Step 1: Install the Bugster SDK

Install Bugster SDK using your package manager:

```bash
npm i @bugster/bugster-js
```

---

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables

Add your environment variables to your `.env.local` file and your hosting provider (such as Vercel, Netlify, AWS).

```bash
BUGSTER_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

---

## Step 3: Initialize Bugster SDK

To initialize Bugster SDK in your Svelte application, follow these steps:

1. Import the ```BugsterTracker``` into your Svelte component.
2. Initialize the SDK inside the ```onMount``` lifecycle function to ensure it runs after the component mounts.

Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
import { BugsterTracker } from '@bugster/bugster-js';
import { onMount } from 'svelte';

let bugster = null;

onMount(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && !bugster) {
    bugster = new BugsterTracker({
      apiKey: process.env.BUGSTER_KEY,
      endpoint: "https://i.bugster.app",
    });
  }
});
```

This will ensure the SDK is properly initialized after the component mounts.
