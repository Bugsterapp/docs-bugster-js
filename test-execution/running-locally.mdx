## Introduction

Running tests locally is an essential part of the development process, allowing you to quickly validate changes, debug issues, and ensure the quality of your application before pushing to shared environments. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running Bugster SDK tests on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Bugster SDK installed in your project
- Node.js (version 14 or later) installed on your machine
- Access to your project's test suite in the Bugster dashboard

## Setting Up Your Local Environment

1. **Install Bugster CLI**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @bugster/cli
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Bugster**

   Run the following command and follow the prompts:

   ```bash
   bugster auth login
   ```

3. **Configure Your Project**

   In your project root, create a `bugster.config.js` file:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     apiKey: 'YOUR_BUGSTER_API_KEY',
     apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
     testDir: './tests',
     browsers: ['chrome', 'firefox'],
     baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'
   };
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_BUGSTER_API_KEY` and `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual project details.

## Downloading Tests

To run tests locally, you first need to download them from the Bugster dashboard:

1. Open your terminal in your project directory.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   bugster tests download
   ```

This will download all the tests associated with your project into the `testDir` specified in your config file.

## Running All Tests

To run all downloaded tests:

1. Ensure your application is running locally (e.g., on `http://localhost:3000`).
2. Open a new terminal window.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   bugster tests run
   ```

## Running Specific Tests

To run a subset of tests:

1. By test file:
   ```bash
   bugster tests run ./tests/login.test.js
   ```

2. By tag:
   ```bash
   bugster tests run --tag smoke
   ```

3. By test suite:
   ```bash
   bugster tests run --suite "Critical Path"
   ```

## Configuring Test Runs

You can customize your test runs using command-line options or by editing your `bugster.config.js` file.

### Command-line Options

- `--browser`: Specify browser(s) to run tests in
  ```bash
  bugster tests run --browser chrome,firefox
  ```

- `--headless`: Run tests in headless mode
  ```bash
  bugster tests run --headless
  ```

- `--parallel`: Set number of parallel test runs
  ```bash
  bugster tests run --parallel 4
  ```

### Configuration File Options

Edit your `bugster.config.js` to set default options:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ... other options
  runConfig: {
    headless: true,
    parallel: 2,
    retries: 2,
    timeout: 30000 // milliseconds
  }
};
```

## Viewing Test Results

After running tests, Bugster CLI will display a summary of the results in your terminal. For a more detailed view:

1. Run tests with the `--report` flag:
   ```bash
   bugster tests run --report
   ```

2. Open the generated HTML report in your browser:
   ```bash
   open bugster-report.html
   ```

## Debugging Failed Tests

When a test fails locally:

1. Re-run the specific failed test with increased verbosity:
   ```bash
   bugster tests run ./tests/failed-test.js --debug
   ```

2. Use the `--stop-on-failure` flag to pause execution at the point of failure:
   ```bash
   bugster tests run --stop-on-failure
   ```

3. Check the screenshots and video recordings in the `./bugster-results` directory.

## Best Practices for Local Test Execution

1. **Run Tests Frequently**: Execute tests after every significant code change.

2. **Use a Consistent Environment**: Ensure your local setup mirrors your CI environment as closely as possible.

3. **Optimize for Speed**: Use parallel execution and headless mode for faster feedback.

4. **Manage Test Data**: Use Bugster's data management features to handle test data consistently across environments.

5. **Version Control Your Config**: Keep your `bugster.config.js` in version control to ensure consistency across the team.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tests Failing Locally but Passing in CI**: 
  - Check for environment-specific configurations.
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed and up-to-date.

- **Slow Test Execution**: 
  - Use headless mode and increase parallelization.
  - Review and optimize wait times in your tests.

- **Browser Launch Failures**: 
  - Verify that the specified browsers are installed on your machine.
  - Check for conflicting browser sessions or processes.

- **Network-Related Failures**:
  - Confirm your application is running and accessible at the specified `baseUrl`.
  - Check your network connection and firewall settings.

## Integrating with Local Development Workflow

1. **Watch Mode**: Use Bugster's watch mode to automatically run relevant tests as you make changes:
   ```bash
   bugster tests run --watch
   ```

2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Set up a pre-commit hook to run tests before allowing commits:
   ```bash
   npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "bugster tests run --tag quick"
   ```

3. **IDE Integration**: Use Bugster's IDE plugins for Visual Studio Code or JetBrains IDEs for seamless test execution from your editor.
