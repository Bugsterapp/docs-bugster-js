## What is Bugster SDK?

Bugster SDK is an innovative end-to-end (e2e) testing solution designed to revolutionize the way developers approach web application testing. It automates the creation, maintenance, and execution of e2e tests, allowing development teams to achieve comprehensive test coverage without the need to write test code manually.

Our SDK empowers developers to create robust, maintainable e2e tests with minimal effort, ensuring that your web applications are thoroughly tested and always up-to-date with your latest changes.

### Core Components

Bugster SDK consists of two main components:

1. **bugster-js**: A lightweight JavaScript snippet integrated into your frontend codebase.
2. **Bugster Testing Framework**: A robust testing framework built on top of Playwright, which generates and executes your tests.

## Why Choose Bugster SDK?

- **Automated Test Creation**: Say goodbye to manually writing e2e tests.
- **Self-Maintaining Tests**: Tests automatically update as your application evolves.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any web framework or library.
- **Flexible Execution**: Run tests locally, in the cloud, or as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Real User Behavior Testing**: Tests based on actual user interactions.
