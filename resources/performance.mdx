At Bugster, we prioritize the performance of your web applications. We've designed our SDK to have minimal impact on your site's speed and user experience. This document provides a detailed analysis of Bugster SDK's performance impact and the measures we've taken to optimize it.

## Key Findings

- Bugster SDK adds an average of **15-25 KB** to your initial page load.
- The SDK's impact on page load time is typically **less than 100ms**.
- CPU usage for event capturing and processing is **negligible** for most applications.
- Memory usage is **optimized** through efficient data structures and periodic garbage collection.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Initial Load Impact

Bugster SDK is designed to load asynchronously, minimizing its impact on your page's initial load time.

- **File Size**: The minified and gzipped SDK is approximately 20 KB.
- **Loading Strategy**: We use a defer loading strategy to ensure the SDK doesn't block other resources.

<script src="https://cdn.bugster.io/sdk.min.js" defer></script>
```

### 2. Runtime Performance

#### Event Capturing

Bugster SDK captures user interactions and application state changes. We've optimized this process to be as lightweight as possible:

- **Event Delegation**: Instead of attaching listeners to individual elements, we use event delegation to minimize the number of event listeners.
- **Throttling and Debouncing**: Frequent events like scrolling and mousemove are throttled to reduce unnecessary processing.

#### Data Processing and Transmission

- **Batching**: Events are batched and sent periodically or when a certain threshold is reached, reducing the number of network requests.
- **Compression**: All data sent to Bugster servers is compressed to minimize bandwidth usage.

### 3. Memory Usage

Bugster SDK is designed to have a small memory footprint:

- **Efficient Data Structures**: We use optimized data structures to store captured events and session information.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old data is periodically cleared from memory to prevent accumulation over long sessions.

### 4. CPU Usage

Our benchmarks show that Bugster SDK typically uses less than 1% of CPU time:

- **Event Loop Impact**: The SDK is designed to yield to the main thread, ensuring smooth user interactions.
- **Background Processing**: Heavy computations, if any, are offloaded to Web Workers where supported.

### 5. Network Impact

Bugster SDK communicates with our servers to send captured data and receive configuration updates:

- **Payload Size**: The average payload size for a typical user session is around 50 KB per 15 minutes of active use.
- **Request Frequency**: By default, data is sent every 30 seconds or when the batch size reaches 100 events, whichever comes first.

## Customization for Performance

Bugster SDK offers several configuration options to further optimize performance for your specific needs:

```javascript
BugsterSDK.init({
  capturePerformance: true,
  eventBatchSize: 50,
  flushInterval: 60000, // 1 minute
  samplingRate: 0.5, // Capture data for 50% of sessions
});
```

## Best Practices for Optimal Performance

1. **Selective Event Capturing**: Only capture events that are relevant to your analysis needs.
2. **Use Sampling**: For high-traffic applications, consider using sampling to reduce data volume.
3. **Regular SDK Updates**: Always use the latest version of Bugster SDK to benefit from ongoing performance improvements.

## Monitoring and Verification

We encourage you to monitor the performance impact of Bugster SDK in your specific application:

1. Use browser developer tools to measure the SDK's impact on load time and runtime performance.
2. Implement your own performance measurements before and after integrating the SDK.
3. Utilize Bugster's built-in performance monitoring features to get insights into the SDK's operation.

## Conclusion

Bugster SDK is engineered to have minimal impact on your web application's performance while providing powerful testing and analytics capabilities. Our team continuously works on optimizing the SDK's performance. If you have any concerns or notice any unexpected performance issues, please don't hesitate to contact our support team.
