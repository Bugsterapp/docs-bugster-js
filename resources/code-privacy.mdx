## How does Bugster SDK ensure the privacy of our codebase?

We understand that your code is your intellectual property, and protecting it is paramount. Our SDK is designed with code privacy in mind, ensuring that your proprietary code and sensitive information remain secure. Here's how we safeguard your code privacy:

## No Source Code Transmission

<Note>
  Bugster SDK **never** transmits your source code or sensitive code-related
  information to our servers.
</Note>

- The SDK operates on a high level, capturing user interactions and application behaviors without accessing or transmitting your actual source code.

## Minimal Code Footprint

- Bugster SDK is designed to have a minimal footprint in your codebase.
- Integration typically requires only a few lines of code, minimizing the exposure of your application structure.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
// Typical Bugster SDK integration
import BugsterSDK from '@bugster/sdk';

BugsterSDK.init({
projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
// Other configuration options
});

````
</CodeGroup>

## Configurable Data Capture

- You have full control over what data is captured and sent to Bugster servers.
- Sensitive areas of your application can be easily excluded from monitoring.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
BugsterSDK.init({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  ignoredUrls: ['/admin', '/sensitive-data'],
  ignoredElements: ['#password-input', '.secret-info']
});
````

</CodeGroup>

## Automatic Sensitive Data Redaction

- Bugster SDK automatically redacts sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and other common types of personal data.
- Custom redaction rules can be set up to handle specific sensitive data in your application.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
BugsterSDK.setRedactionRules([
  {
    pattern: /api_key=([^&]+)/g,
    replacement: 'api_key=[REDACTED]'
  }
]);
```
</CodeGroup>

## No Access to Server-Side Code

- Bugster SDK operates entirely on the client-side.
- We have no access to your server-side code or backend infrastructure.

## Secure Storage and Handling

- Any data collected by the SDK is securely transmitted and stored following industry best practices.
- We use encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).

## Data Processing Agreement

- We offer a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) that outlines our commitment to handling your data securely and in compliance with regulations like GDPR.

## Code Obfuscation

- The Bugster SDK itself is obfuscated to protect our intellectual property and to prevent reverse engineering.
- This obfuscation also adds an extra layer of security to your integration.

## Open Source Components

- We are transparent about any open-source components used in our SDK.
- You can review our dependencies to ensure they meet your security standards.

<Tip>
  Check our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bugster-app/bugster-sdk) for
  a list of dependencies and their licenses.
</Tip>

## Regular Security Audits

- We conduct regular security audits of our SDK to ensure it maintains the highest standards of security and privacy.

## Customizable Logging

- You can control the level of logging performed by the SDK, ensuring that no sensitive information is inadvertently logged.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript BugsterSDK.setLogLevel('error'); // Only log errors
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Local Testing Options

- We provide options for local testing and debugging without sending data to our servers, allowing you to verify the SDK's behavior in a controlled environment.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
BugsterSDK.init({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  debugMode: true,
  localStorageOnly: true
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Compliance and Certifications

- While we are currently working towards formal certifications, our practices are designed to meet industry standards for data protection and privacy.
- We are committed to achieving relevant certifications (e.g., ISO 27001) as part of our ongoing security roadmap.

## Transparency and Communication

- We maintain clear documentation about what data is collected and how it's used.
- Our team is always available to discuss any specific code privacy concerns you may have.

<Note>
  If you have specific code privacy requirements or questions, please don't
  hesitate to reach out to our security team at security@bugster.app. We're here
  to ensure that Bugster SDK meets your code privacy needs.
</Note>

By implementing these measures, we ensure that integrating Bugster SDK into your application does not compromise the privacy or security of your codebase. We're committed to maintaining the highest standards of code privacy and continuously improving our practices to protect your intellectual property.
