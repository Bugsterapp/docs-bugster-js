This Quick Start Guide will walk you through the process of integrating Bugster SDK into your web application and generating your first automated test. By the end of this guide, you'll have Bugster SDK set up and capturing user interactions.

## Step 1: Install Bugster SDK

First, install the Bugster SDK package in your project:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @bugster/bugster-js
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @bugster/bugster-js
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @bugster/bugster-js
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Import and Initialize Bugster SDK

Add the following code to your main JavaScript or TypeScript file:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
import BugsterTracker from '@bugster/bugster-js';

BugsterTracker.init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_BUGSTER_API_KEY',
});
```

```typescript TypeScript
import BugsterTracker from '@bugster/bugster-js';

BugsterTracker.init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_BUGSTER_API_KEY',
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `'YOUR_BUGSTER_API_KEY'` with your actual Bugster project ID.

<Note>
You can find your project ID in the Bugster dashboard under Project Settings.
</Note>

## Step 3: Verify Installation

To ensure Bugster SDK is initialized correctly, add a callback function:

```javascript
BugsterTracker.init({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_BUGSTER_API_KEY',
  onInitialized: () => {
    console.log('Bugster SDK initialized successfully!');
  },
});
```

Run your application and check the browser console for the success message.

## Step 4: Capture User Interactions

Once initialized, Bugster SDK automatically starts capturing user interactions. No additional code is required for basic capturing.

To test this:
1. Run your application
2. Perform some typical user actions (e.g., click buttons, fill forms)
3. These interactions will be sent to the Bugster servers

## Step 5: View Captured Interactions

To view the captured interactions:

1. Log in to your [Bugster Dashboard](https://dashboard.bugster.app)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click on "Captured Interactions"

You should see a list of recent user interactions from your application.

## Step 6: Generate Your First Test

Now that you've captured some interactions, let's generate a test:

1. In the Bugster Dashboard, go to "Captured Interactions"
2. Select a sequence of interactions you want to turn into a test
3. Click "Generate Test"
4. Review the generated test script
5. Click "Save Test" to add it to your test suite

## Step 7: Run Your Generated Test

To run your newly generated test:

1. In the Bugster Dashboard, go to "Test Suite"
2. Find your new test in the list
3. Click "Run Test"
4. Wait for the test to complete and view the results

<Tip>
You can also run tests locally or integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline. Check our [Advanced Usage Guide](/advanced-usage) for more details.
