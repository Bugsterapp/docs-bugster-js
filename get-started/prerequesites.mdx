Before you begin integrating Bugster SDK into your project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place. Meeting these requirements will ensure a smooth installation and setup process.

## Software Requirements

### Node.js

Bugster SDK requires Node.js to be installed on your system.

- **Version**: 19.x or later

To check your Node.js and npm versions, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
```

If you need to install or update Node.js, visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Web Browser

For local testing, you'll need one of the following web browsers:

- Google Chrome (latest version)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
- Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based, latest version)

<Tip>
Bugster SDK uses Playwright under the hood, which supports these browsers out of the box. For a full list of supported browsers, check the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers).
</Tip>

## Bugster Account

To use Bugster SDK, you'll need:

- A Bugster account (sign up at [bugster.app](https://www.bugster.app/auth/sign-up) if you haven't already)
- Your Bugster api key (you can find this in your Bugster dashboard)

<Note>
If you're part of a team, make sure you have the necessary permissions to add new integrations to your Bugster project.
</Note>

## Network Requirements

Bugster SDK needs to communicate with our servers to function properly. Ensure that:

- Your development machine has internet access
- Your firewall allows outgoing connections to `*.bugster.app`

If you're working in a corporate environment with strict network policies, you may need to whitelist Bugster's domains. Contact your IT department if you need assistance.

## Next Steps

Once you have all these prerequisites in place, you're ready to move on to the [Installation](/get-started/installation) process. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the prerequisites, please check our [FAQ](/faq) or [contact our support team](https://bugster.app/support).
