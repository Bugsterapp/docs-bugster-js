Before you begin integrating Bugster SDK into your project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place. Meeting these requirements will ensure a smooth installation and setup process.

## System Requirements

### Supported Operating Systems

Bugster SDK is compatible with the following operating systems:

- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later
- **macOS**: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later

## Software Requirements

### Node.js

- Google Chrome (latest version)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
- Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based, latest version)

<Tip>
Bugster SDK uses Playwright under the hood, which supports these browsers out of the box. For a full list of supported browsers, check the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers).
</Tip>

## Development Environment

### Code Editor

While not strictly required, we recommend using a modern code editor such as:

- Visual Studio Code
- WebStorm
- Sublime Text

These editors offer great JavaScript/TypeScript support and can enhance your development experience with Bugster SDK.

### Version Control

We strongly recommend using a version control system, preferably Git. This will help you track changes and collaborate with your team more effectively.

## Bugster Account

To use Bugster SDK, you'll need:

- A Bugster account (sign up at [bugster.app](https://bugster.app) if you haven't already)
- Your Bugster project ID (you can find this in your Bugster dashboard)

<Note>
If you're part of a team, make sure you have the necessary permissions to add new integrations to your Bugster project.
</Note>

## Network Requirements

Bugster SDK needs to communicate with our servers to function properly. Ensure that:

- Your development machine has internet access
- Your firewall allows outgoing connections to `*.bugster.app`

If you're working in a corporate environment with strict network policies, you may need to whitelist Bugster's domains. Contact your IT department if you need assistance.
